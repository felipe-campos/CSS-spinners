CSS spinners
============

A collection of pure CSS spinners, forged by boredom in the dark plains of Sweden. Feel free to contribute with spinners or ideas for spinners!

Compatibility
-------------

The spinners are tested in Blink (Chrome) and Gecko (Firefox) and should theoretically work in any Webkit based browser as well. They will definitely not work in IE < 11. I would suggest a fallback to GIF or SVG for older browsers.
